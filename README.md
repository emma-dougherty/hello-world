# My Background
For ten years I ran the business I set up, **StopMoGo** (https://stopmogo.com), providing stop motion animation workshops - for children, as well as, adults. Themes included dinosaurs, Ancient Egypt, pirates, Alice in Wonderland, Space (and *a lot* more!). I also made a whole host of films myself. Before that I was a primary school teacher. I got the bug for web development back in 2010 when I created my first website. Excited to be starting the PSD course at **CodeClan**, not to mention, bracing myself for the challenges ahead!
